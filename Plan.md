These are excellent feature ideas! Letâ€™s refine and incorporate them into a development plan, ensuring each feature is structured for efficiency and usability. Below is a detailed breakdown for the features you mentioned:

---

### **Feature Breakdown**

#### **1. Basic Management**

- **Purpose**: Core functionality for tracking finances.
- **Features**:
  - **Accounts**: Users can create multiple accounts (e.g., Bank, Cash, Credit Card).
  - **Income and Expenses**:
    - Categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Bills, Entertainment).
    - Visualize spending by category and time period.
  - **Balance Overview**: Show total balance across all accounts.
- **Implementation**:
  - SQLite database:
    - `accounts` table: `id`, `name`, `type` (e.g., Savings, Credit), `balance`.
    - `transactions` table: `id`, `account_id`, `type` (income/expense), `category`, `amount`, `date`.
  - Backend APIs for CRUD operations.
  - Angular components for transaction management and account summaries.

#### **2. Investment Tracking**

- **Purpose**: Track the value of investments and monitor asset prices dynamically.
- **Features**:
  - **Add Investments**: Input details like asset name, quantity, purchase price, and category (stocks, crypto, etc.).
  - **Price Sync**: Fetch current prices from APIs:
    - **TradingView API** for stock prices.
    - **CoinMarketCap API** for crypto prices.
  - **Portfolio Summary**: Show total value, gains/losses, and asset breakdown.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `investments` table: `id`, `asset_name`, `quantity`, `purchase_price`, `category`, `last_updated_price`.
  - Backend service for API integration to fetch live prices and update investment values.
  - Angular dashboard for:
    - Adding and viewing investments.
    - Displaying a summary (e.g., charts for portfolio allocation, performance trends).

#### **3. Project Manager**

- **Purpose**: Plan financial projects and allocate funds effectively.
- **Features**:
  - **Create Projects**: Define a project with a name, goal amount, and description.
  - **Add Items**: List items or tasks with their estimated costs.
  - **Track Savings**: Allocate saved money to the project and view progress.
  - **Completion Tracker**: Indicate when items or the entire project is fully funded.
- **Implementation**:
  - SQLite tables:
    - `projects`: `id`, `name`, `goal_amount`, `description`, `total_saved`.
    - `project_items`: `id`, `project_id`, `item_name`, `estimated_cost`, `status` (funded/unfunded).
  - Backend APIs:
    - Endpoints to add/edit/delete projects and items.
    - Endpoint to allocate saved money to a project.
  - Angular Components:
    - Project list and detailed view.
    - Forms for creating/editing projects and items.
    - Progress bars for savings.

#### **4. Spending Simulator**

- **Purpose**: Help users visualize the financial impact of potential purchases.
- **Features**:
  - **Simulate Purchases**:
    - Input purchase details (e.g., cost, monthly installments, start date).
    - Simulate how the purchase will impact the user's budget over time.
  - **Comparison**: Show how different payment plans (e.g., lump sum vs. installments) affect cash flow.
  - **Insights**: Warn users if the purchase exceeds their budget or causes shortfalls.
- **Implementation**:
  - Calculation Engine:
    - Use Python to calculate monthly impacts and future balances.
    - Create scenarios with various interest rates or payment terms.
  - Angular UI:
    - Form for entering simulation details.
    - Visuals (graphs or charts) showing cash flow before and after purchase.
    - Summary of affordability or potential issues.

### **Updated Development Plan**

#### **Frontend (Angular)**

1. **Modules and Components**:
   - **Accounts Module**: Manage accounts, transactions, and balances.
   - **Investments Module**: Add/view investments and sync prices via APIs.
   - **Projects Module**: Create and manage projects with items and savings.
   - **Simulator Module**: Simulate spending and visualize impacts.
2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Use Angular Material for forms, tables, and progress bars.
   - Integrate Chart.js/D3.js for analytics and visualizations.

#### **Backend (Python)**

1. **API Services**:
   - Basic management (CRUD for accounts, transactions, budgets).
   - Investment price sync (TradingView, CoinMarketCap API integration).
   - Project management (CRUD for projects and items).
   - Spending simulator (calculation logic and result generation).
2. **Database Schema**:
   - Tables for accounts, transactions, budgets, investments, projects, and simulations.
3. **Data Validation**:
   - Use FastAPI's pydantic models for input validation and error handling.
